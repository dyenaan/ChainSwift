# Chainswift

Welcome to Chainswift, a platform developed for the Chainshift Hackathon. This uses the internet computer blockchain to provide a decentralized and secure means of verifying students' identity. By using the safety and immutability that the blockchain provides, students are able to store their ID information and provide proof of identification just as they would with a traditional ID.  

# Features
* Uses the Internet Identity as a means of authentication.
* Safe and secure digital storage for student IDs and records.
* Provides a means of virtual verification with a QR code.

# Technologies
* This is built on the Internet computer Blockchain
* ReactJs for the UI/frontend
* Azle Framework(Typescript) for the backend

We hope that with this, soon enough there will be no need for physical IDs anymore :)
This repository serves as a proof-of-concept used to show the functionality of chainswift.
